# Language basics : Mathclc.java
This program calculates the volume of earth and sun and the ratio between them by simply using the volume of sphere equation where the radius is half of the diameter and finally prints the values.

# TASK2
# Language Basics  : Prime.java
This program prints all prime numbers from 2 to 50 by checking divisibility only up to the square root of each number.
If a divisor is found, it skips the current number using a labeled continue; otherwise, it prints the prime.

# TASK3
# Object Basics : text.java
This program takes a text(String) and extracts total number of letters, spaces between words, vowels and consonants by character iteration using simple 'for loop'.

# Task 4 
# Object Basics : SoliloquySorter.java
The program takes a text, extracts all the words (ignoring punctuation), and converts them to lowercase. It then sorts these words alphabetically using bubble sort and prints the sorted list. Essentially, it turns a paragraph into an ordered list of words.
